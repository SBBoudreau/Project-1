Project Description/Outline: 
We will be using weather data and available GDP data to establish correlations between rainfall and temperature changes.   We will further analyze the possible effects on the three classifications of GDP. 
Research Questions to Answer:
1.	How Temperature changes affect the GDP in the chosen countries
•	Look for discernable trends in GDP ∆’s and temperature fluctuations over a 5 year period.
2.	How Annual rainfall affect the GDP in the chosen countries
•	Look for discernable trends in GDP ∆’s and annual temperature over a 5 year period.
•	Take a deeper look into flooding, tsunamis
3.	How Weather affects GDP in Agriculture based economies
•	Analyze weather changes and/or percentage rainfall for countries whose GDP is predominantly agricultural based (countries where the percentage of agricultural land is the lowest (least dependent on agriculture) would be Suriname (0.53%), Greenland(0.57%), Singapore(0.95%), and the Bahamas(1.40%).
4.	How Weather affects GDP in Industrial based economies
•	Analyze weather changes and/or percentage rainfall for countries whose GDP is predominantly industry based (e.g., Saudi Arabia: 44.2%, 49.8%: United Arab Emirates, Iraq: 51%, Qatar: 50.3%, Kuwait: 58.7%, Angola: 61.4%, Azerbaijan: 53.5%, Puerto Rico: 50.1%, Libya: 52.3%, et cetera.)
5.	How Weather affects GDP in Service based economies
•	Analyze weather changes and/or percentage rainfall for countries whose GDP is predominantly service based (GDP is predominately or highly service based, e.g., European Union: 70.9%, United States: 80%, United Kingdom: 79.2%, Hong Kong: 92.3%, Panama: 82%, Lebanon: 83%, Macau: 93.7%, Bermuda: 93.8%, et cetera).

Data Sets to be Used: 
IMF Data, GDP Data, Weather Data

Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
Each team member will answer one of the five questions posed above.  Additionally, we will all work together on API’s, building the data sets for said project, and building the final Jupyter Notebook.
